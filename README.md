# Hello again,✌️

This is a project I developed in collaboration with a team during my internship at AppsFlyer.
It is a web-based application designed to manage work relationships between product managers in the organization, 
facilitating quarterly planning and including user and admin access permissions. 
The project aims to streamline decision-making processes between teams and enhance collaboration.
